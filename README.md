# Pritunl-Client-for-Linux-Helper

## What is it.
Designed especially for Linux users with no time on their hands, this is a beautiful front-end UI to speed up the task of connecting and disconnecting from  Pritunl VPN endpoints

## What I hope for it to achieve.
Pritunl Inc are welcome to incorporate this script into the tool. If you do, please submit an issue so that other users can be informed. 

## Why was it created
I created this script because the GUI Pritunl client is not yet supported on Ubuntu 24.04 at the time.

## Why I really like it
It also helps because  I find my internet connection being terrible after being connected to 2 VPN servers at the same time. This script stops this behavior by disconnecting any existing sessions before establishing a new VPN session.
